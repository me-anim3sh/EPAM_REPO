Remove all permissions for groups and others.
Provide directory name through command-line.
After running script all files in the given directory, Only should have all the permissions.
But remember dont add any permission to user only change to others and groups.

Answer---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

# Check if directory name is provided through command-line
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
echo "ERROR: Please provide directory name as an argument."
exit 1
fi

# Assign directory name to a variable
dir_name=$1

# Check if directory exists
if [ ! -d "$dir_name" ]; then
echo "ERROR: Directory does not exist."
exit 1
fi

# Remove all permissions for groups and others
chmod o-rwx,g-rwx $dir_name

# Add all permissions for user
chmod u+rwx $dir_name

# Confirm permissions have been set
ls -ld $dir_name
